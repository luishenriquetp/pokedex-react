# Pokedex-React - Mate Academy React test

This repository contains a very basic implementation for a React app connected to the Poke API.

For now, it displays a fixed pokemon image and lists the name for all pokemons.

The objective of the task is to make it so that by switching the pokemon name, the image will also change.
Each pokemon should be displayed in a simple card with minimal info.
Also, a list with all pokemon names should be displayed in a grid below the switch. Mobile grid: 2 columns, Tablet grid: 3 columns, Others: 4 columns.
Clicking on a given name, should show that pokemon also.
User should be able to filter pokemons by type, default is ALL (no filter).
